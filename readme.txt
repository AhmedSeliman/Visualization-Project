-Employment Status & income range which is a sign of solvency and the folloing figure depicts it with thier varios condition : example if the income of the borrower is 0 we can see from the grid color bar that the interest imposed is near to 24% which is consider the highest because of the it's high risk they impose a higher interest rate on them.
- Borrowers with the income slice range of 25,000 to 75,000 have the highest frequency of getting loans in our dataset.
